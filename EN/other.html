            1.If you want to add something, just add it yourself ，but please follow<button class="button3" onclick="location.href='creator.html'">👉🏻 rule for creator 👈🏻</button><br>
            2.Owners and admin also apply to rules<br>
            3.Private messages are unwilling to the server, even if someone keeps bothering you, I will not interfere, please block him yourself<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3-1.With one exception: someone sends canned mail with a private message (eg: someone sends you a link saying it's Nirto, etc.) Please tell me this counts as <button class="button3" onclick="location.href='warn.html'">👉🏻 rule for warn 👈🏻2.</button><br>
            4.False accusation<br>
            5.Perjury (While being a witness, if there is concealment of the fact, false report, etc. will constitute)<br>
            6.Crimes of Destruction Example: After someone has been reported for swiping, delete the swiping message<br>
            7.I can add new rules by joint signature (but I have to think it is very reasonable)<br>
            8.We will use high-level personnel to kick out or withdraw some personnel who caused the server problems (we will not cause unjust cases rationally)<br>
