            7.The creator does not apply to some rules. For example: I created a voice box and everyone who enters this box must agree or acquiesce to me. If I do not agree, the rules of the voice room do not apply. Simply put, you can do whatever you want with your own box, but only for that box. "Creator details rules can go to this category"<br>
            8.Respect everyone who needs to use it. Please cooperate with others if they have any needs.<br>
